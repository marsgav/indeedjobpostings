Software Engineer,"New York, NY 10013 (SoHo area)",Carta,None,"Come help us build the Carta Investor Experience
We’re looking for a talented engineer to join our team in the Investor Services business unit.
The Company You’ll Join
At Carta we create owners and make private markets liquid.
We live in a world where some people live on the equity stack and enjoy exponential wealth growth and preferential tax treatment; others live on the debt stack and may work their entire lives for a company and retire only with the cash they’ve managed to save from their paychecks. Our contribution to solving the wealth inequality problem is moving people from the debt stack (payroll) to the equity stack. By making it as easy to issue equity to employees as it is to put them on payroll, we can create more owners.
At Carta, we are helpful, transparent, fair, and kind. We are relentless executors, unconventional thinkers, and masters of our craft.
To learn more, here is what one of our investors wrote about leading our Series
The Team You’ll Work With
The team you’ll join is the Enable team within Investor Services. We’re in charge of the first impression our customers have of Carta and setting them up for success down the road. It’s a big responsibility and we relish the challenge. It requires curiosity, grit, collaboration, and incisive thinking; and we’ve got those in spades. Our team nurtures open minded exploration and cares about outcomes over output. We measure success not by features shipped or lines of code written, but rather by the impact we drive for the business.
We are Carson, Jeff, Ashley, Julian, Jess, Jun, Mallik, Leo. In our spare time, we’re working on setting up a live stream of Momo (Jess’s new cat, who makes frequent Zoom appearances).
The Problems You’ll Solve
Our Fund Admin business has grown really quickly, so this year we’ve taken on big projects to understand and standardize data for the customers we work with. We’re solving the problem of accurately modeling the world in our software. We believe this is the key to turning our service business into a product business. We’re really excited to start building on top of our new foundation the rest of this year.
Some of the problems you’ll help us solve are:
How do you untangle dependencies and design an extensible architecture that increases development velocity and reduces bugs?
How do you model unstructured data and relationships in the venture capital ecosystem to help scale the business into new, more complex markets?
How do you design a multi-sided platform that fosters collaboration across many user types each with different goals and contexts?
The Impact You’ll Have
If we can solve these problems, we will be setting up our customers, our business, and our industry for long term success. Our customers will see accurate data, understand their accounts, and make better investment decisions. Our onboarding team will be able to spend their time delivering white glove service rather than doing manual data entry. Our business teams will be able to expand into new, more complex markets based on our foundational work.
The final result of our efforts will be an accurate graph of the venture capital network. On top of this graph we will build the financial products of the future: instant investment funds, next-gen banking products, and a stock exchange. Without this graph capital markets may stay stuck in the middle ages.
About You
You want to help solve problems that are big and meaty. You like untangling messy balls of yarn. You do so by digging deep and seeking to understand - the business, the users, the product, and the technology. You reflect and strive to master your craft. You measure yourself by the impact you drive for the business and for the company. You seek to serve - our customers, our company, and our team. You like working with a team bound by a common purpose.
The Interview Process
We are an equal opportunity employer and are committed to providing a positive interview experience for every candidate. If accommodations due to a disability or medical condition are needed, connect with us via email at recruiting@carta.com. As a company, we value fairness, helpfulness, transparency, leadership and build our teams around these values.

Associate Research Scholar (Data) Brown Institute,"New York, NY 10027 (Manhattanville area)",Columbia University,None,"The David and Helen Gurley Brown Institute for Media Innovation was founded in 2012 and is a joint effort between Stanford’s School of Engineering and Columbia Journalism School (CJS). Each year, the Brown Institute awards close to $1M in grants and fellowships to foster new tools and modes of expression, and to create stories that escape the bounds of page and screen. We are committed to radical experimentation with the potential to define new priorities and practices for both engineering and journalism.
The Brown Institute at CJS is seeking a Research Scholar (open rank) to serve as a data specialist in support the Institute’s research and grants. This person will play both a high-level role reporting directly to the Director of the Institute at Columbia, helping provide data expertise and assistance to the Institute’s various grant and fellowship programs, as well as assisting in the implementation of seminars and workshops that engage the CJS and Columbia University (CU) communities in data-related topics.
The primary function of the Institute is to serve as a grant making organization. As such, the Institute has funded over 50 projects, supporting well over 150 grantees and fellows. Due to our position as a joint venture between Stanford Engineering and Columbia Journalism School, as well as seismic shifts in the journalism industry that have led many organizations to focus heavily on data and computation, many of our projects are rooted in data-based storytelling. In our 2019-2020 Magic Grant cycle alone, the Brown Institute at Columbia is explicitly supporting three projects that are essentially database research endeavours. One project, for example, is focused on acquiring and aggregating human rights violations in Pakistan to enable better reporting on the country. Another project is focused on producing a comprehensive database of maternal deaths in Nigeria, as well as providing systematic assessment of the efficacy of health interventions in the country. And yet another project is developing an automated database of the Trump administration’s 3000+ current and former appointees, enabling journalists to report on stories about appointees’ interests and potential conflicts, and how those impact policymaking.
The Research Scholar will be the lead data scientist for these projects — creating databases from possibly unstructured information; designing systems for the ingest, automation, and cleaning of future data; and helping journalists pull stories from the data. In addition to grants and fellowships, the Institute offers a number of pedagogical programs, from simple open office hours on topics like Data Visualization and Mapping, to seminars and conferences about the role of data in journalism. The Research Scholar will have the opportunity to assist in these efforts, helping design and lead workshops, provide office hours to the school, and work on personal projects that align with the mission of the Institute. This is an exciting new role that will leverage the incredible grants we have funded, as well as our connections to industry and to the academic environment in which we exist.
These tasks mean that the Research Scholar should have a firm grounding in all things data. Applicants should be fluent in at least one programming language, preferably Python or R, and should have a history of learning new technological platforms as well as a general curiosity about how technology might shape narrative. The Research Scholar will also be encouraged to seek out and develop their own novel data projects, and might also teach a course in the CJS, with the goal of promoting the mix of data and journalism in new ways.
This position will be appointed for up to 12 months, may be renewable contingent on performance and the continued availability of funding.

An appreciation for the power of a good story and the ability to experiment with the technical means of its production are key.

"Software Engineer, Investor Enablement","New York, NY 10013 (SoHo area)",Carta,None,"Come help us build the Carta Investor Experience
We're looking for a talented engineer to join our team in the Investor Services business unit.
The Company You'll Join
At Carta we create owners and make private markets liquid.
We live in a world where some people live on the equity stack and enjoy exponential wealth growth and preferential tax treatment; others live on the debt stack and may work their entire lives for a company and retire only with the cash they've managed to save from their paychecks. Our contribution to solving the wealth inequality problem is moving people from the debt stack (payroll) to the equity stack. By making it as easy to issue equity to employees as it is to put them on payroll, we can create more owners.
At Carta, we are helpful, transparent, fair, and kind. We are relentless executors, unconventional thinkers, and masters of our craft.
To learn more, here is what one of our investors wrote about leading our Series
The Team You'll Work With
The team you'll join is the Enable team within Investor Services. We're in charge of the first impression our customers have of Carta and setting them up for success down the road. It's a big responsibility and we relish the challenge. It requires curiosity, grit, collaboration, and incisive thinking; and we've got those in spades. Our team nurtures open minded exploration and cares about outcomes over output. We measure success not by features shipped or lines of code written, but rather by the impact we drive for the business.
We are Carson, Jeff, Ashley, Julian, Jess, Jun, Mallik, Leo. In our spare time, we're working on setting up a live stream of Momo (Jess's new cat, who makes frequent Zoom appearances).
The Problems You'll Solve
Our Fund Admin business has grown really quickly, so this year we've taken on big projects to understand and standardize data for the customers we work with. We're solving the problem of accurately modeling the world in our software. We believe this is the key to turning our service business into a product business. We're really excited to start building on top of our new foundation the rest of this year.
Some of the problems you'll help us solve are:
How do you untangle dependencies and design an extensible architecture that increases development velocity and reduces bugs?
How do you model unstructured data and relationships in the venture capital ecosystem to help scale the business into new, more complex markets?
How do you design a multi-sided platform that fosters collaboration across many user types each with different goals and contexts?
The Impact You'll Have
If we can solve these problems, we will be setting up our customers, our business, and our industry for long term success. Our customers will see accurate data, understand their accounts, and make better investment decisions. Our onboarding team will be able to spend their time delivering white glove service rather than doing manual data entry. Our business teams will be able to expand into new, more complex markets based on our foundational work.
The final result of our efforts will be an accurate graph of the venture capital network. On top of this graph we will build the financial products of the future: instant investment funds, next-gen banking products, and a stock exchange. Without this graph capital markets may stay stuck in the middle ages.
About You
You want to help solve problems that are big and meaty. You like untangling messy balls of yarn. You do so by digging deep and seeking to understand - the business, the users, the product, and the technology. You reflect and strive to master your craft. You measure yourself by the impact you drive for the business and for the company. You seek to serve - our customers, our company, and our team. You like working with a team bound by a common purpose.
The Interview Process
We are an equal opportunity employer and are committed to providing a positive interview experience for every candidate. If accommodations due to a disability or medical condition are needed, connect with us via email at recruiting@carta.com. As a company, we value fairness, helpfulness, transparency, leadership and build our teams around these values.

Senior Ai Scientist,"New York, NY",Accrete.AI,None,"Location: New York, USA
About Us
We believe that the way humans conduct analytical work will undergo radical transformation over the next several years. Due to an explosion in digital information and cognitive limitations of the human brain, it is impossible for human analysts to capture the true complexity associated with forecasting future events using pre-defined factors. As such, we specialize in building dynamic, continuously learning models that automate complex cognitive tasks typically performed by human analysts. Our mission at Accrete.AI is to scale human expertise and compound the world's knowledge for the purpose of making accurate predictions about the real world that impact financial markets.

We accomplish this by leveraging domain experts to create semantically rich training data on the order of less than 1% of the data from which our models continuously learn. As a result, we are able to produce a non-linear return on the cognitive effort expended by domain experts. Our dynamic continuously learning models, activated by proprietary mathematical functions, underlie an AI platform with a variety of core capabilities including intelligent web crawling, contextual analytics and semantic search. Leveraging these core capabilities, we build smart analytical tools that continuously read, understand and learn in specialized ways. As our smart analytical tools learn, they extract hidden features buried in complexity that surface predictive insights that would be impossible to find using traditional intelligence and tools.

Our products are helping customers generate alpha by identifying and ranking sources most likely to publish reliable, market moving M&A rumors; monitor important shifts in topical nuance based on the interplay between management commentary and analyst questions in earnings transcripts; and monitor patient chatter on the efficacy and safety of clinical drug trials.

To Apply:
The first stage of the process is the application below. In order to be considered, you must submit an application that consists of all four components: 1 - Resume, 2 - Cover letter, 3 - Evidence of student learning, and 4 -Original Curricular tool. The requirements for each of the four components are specified in detail below.
1. RESUME: Please submit an up-to-date resume.
2. COVER LETTER: Please submit a well-written cover letter. Please include information about your experience teaching Physical Education to kindergarten students.
3. EVIDENCE OF STUDENT LEARNING: Submit one of the following three options:
Option A: NEW (DUE TO COVID-19 SCHOOL CLOSURES)
We understand you may be unable to provide a recorded video of you teaching in a classroom setting. If you do not have a video with students in the classroom (per the instructions below) you may still submit a video of yourself teaching. Get creative! You may include a video of you teaching (a) a lesson with/for no students, (b) a lesson of you teaching family members, (c) or a lesson for students virtually. We're excited to see your creativity. The video must be accompanied by a written narrative that analyzes and reflects upon the teaching that occurs in the lesson. There is no minimum or maximum length for the narrative. The video may be submitted in any format, but a link to a video posted online is preferred.
An unedited video clip (maximum 15 minutes) of you teaching in a classroom setting (preferred) or a small-group setting. It is preferred that the students be in the same grade-level as the TEP teaching position for which you are applying, though this is not a strict requirement. The video may contain only one continuous, unedited clip (i.e. do not splice together multiple clips from different points in the lesson). The clip does not need to show an entire lesson; a brief lesson segment is perfectly acceptable. The video must be accompanied by a written narrative that analyzes and reflects upon the teaching and learning that occurs in the lesson and may offer an explanation as to what occurred prior to and subsequent to the clip. There is no minimum or maximum length for the narrative. The video may be submitted in any format, but a link to a video posted online is preferred.
Option B: A portfolio of student work that demonstrates the progress of at least two specific students that you have taught. The portfolio must contain a minimum of two work products for each student (for a minimum of four work products) completed at different points in time during the period when each student was in your class. The portfolio must be accompanied by a written narrative that analyzes and reflects upon the progress that each student demonstrates. There is no minimum or maximum length for the narrative.
Option C: Assessment data for at least one entire class of students that you have taught. The assessments may be standardized national, state, or city assessments or your own self-created assessments. The assessment data can be provided in any form that you choose (official documents with students' last names crossed-out, or documents that you create to summarize student assessment performance). The data you provide should ideally show progress over time; as such, it is recommended (though not required) that you provide data for at least two assessments taken at different points in time. The assessment data must be accompanied by a copy of the assessments themselves. If a specific assessment is unavailable, provide a copy of a similar assessment. The assessment data must also be accompanied by a written narrative that provides background on the assessments, explains how the assessments measure student performance, and analyzes the results of your class. There is no minimum or maximum length for the narrative.
4. ORIGINAL CURRICULAR TOOL: Please submit one original curricular tool of any form that you have personally developed. The requirement here is deliberately open-ended because we are interested in seeing anything that you have developed that you believe has meaningfully supported your students' learning. This may take the form of written materials, a unique instructional methodology, a technological innovation, etc.
