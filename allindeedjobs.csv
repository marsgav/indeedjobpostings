ABOUT GLEAN (currently in stealth mode)
Glean is injecting intelligence into expense management. Founded by fintech veteran and seasoned CFO Howard Katzenberg, Glean is an AI-powered spend intelligence solution that saves SMBs money by analyzing expense drivers and finding line-item level insights overlooked by most accounts payable solutions, which are focused on speeding up payment cycles rather than optimizing vendor spend.
Over time, our mission is to become the all-in-one spend management solution for SMBs that uses AI to: analyze spend, manage approval and payment workflows, identify anomalous spend & savings opportunities, benchmark spend performance vs. peers, find & negotiate savings with vendors, and forecast future expense trends.
Glean will be every finance team’s best friend!
Join us!
ABOUT THIS ROLE
We are building the next billion-dollar business in enterprise SAAS. We have an amazing founding team, with experts in product, engineering, data science, and machine learning, and we just launched our MVP. We are now searching for a data scientist that will own the core data science work, build NLP applications, and generate insights.
After we ingest PDFs from clients, we perform OCR, extract the text using text classification models, validate the extraction with a human in the loop, and then map all the data into our canonical taxonomy.
Once the data is mapped to our taxonomy, we have a clean digital invoice-based data asset. We generate insights using this data asset, surfacing line-item level insights to our clients via our web app.
Your role will be critical to generating this intelligence for our clients.
Here are some of the major items you will own at Glean:
Data science code to clean and prepare the data extracted from invoices, including handling nulls, addressing exceptions, imputing data (when possible), and enriching data using third-party APIs
Data science code to validate the goodness of extractions performed by the ML models + human in the loop
Collaborate with vendors to perform OCR and text classification
Develop NLP models to map the extracted data to our canonical taxonomy of vendors and line items (e.g., using word embeddings, etc.) at scale
Once the data has been mapped to the canonical taxonomy, perform feature engineering, generate insights, detect anomalies, and surface the intelligence in a digestible format to the end user
You will work closely with the data engineers to productionize the data science and machine learning code that is developed, and you will work closely with the engineering team to make sure the data science and machine learning pipelines are performant in production.
You’ll be accountable for Glean’s:
Data science vision – ownership over and definition of the data science pipeline, working closely with the executive team, and acting as a thought leader across the company
Technical execution – define, articulate, and execute the data science strategy from launch to scale, managing the day-to-day execution, and implementing best practices
Fast prototyping culture – Develop data science and machine learning applications fast, prototyping quickly to solve thorny business problems without getting bogged down in theory (ship early and often)
Getting your hands dirty - we’re a small team and we have a lot of work ahead of us. You should be excited to roll up your sleeves and help the team in any way you can
Build, build, build – jumping in and writing data science code, from architecture to fixing bugs, delivering NLP and insights within the three months of hire. We'll rely on you and your team to handle day-to-day execution including:
Cleaning the extracted data, validating the accuracy of the extraction, and addressing issues as they occur
Shipping NLP applications to perform mapping of extracted data at scale
Developing and deploying models using PyTorch or TensorFlow
Writing code using PySpark
Performing feature engineering on the cleansed and mapped data
Generating insights and narratives
Performing anomaly detection to surface what the client needs to know fast
Wrangling, standardizing, enhancing, implementing, and monitoring data repositories
Creating workflows to ingest, enrich, and make data available across the Glean platform
PERFECT FIT
You’ll be a perfect fit for the Glean Team if…
You want to join an early-stage startup or you are extremely anxious to be challenged at your first startup
You like the tension between craft and shipping. You have strong ability to quickly and effectively evaluate technical tradeoffs and translate them into short/long term business decisions
You’ve built highly scalable data pipelines and have deep expertise in setting technical vision, architecting, building, and maintaining performant systems, from launch to scale
You are passionate about building / leading data science teams and rapidly developing data pipelines at various stages of growth
You pride yourself in communicating complex concepts, including the ability to distill intricate workflows and systems into clear processes and decisions with measurable company-wide impact
You ask “why” a lot and use critical thinking and data to back up your intuitions. You hate when a customer struggles through your product experience
You have managed a budget before and have seen first-hand the challenges in managing vendor spend

We help the world's biggest brands reach consumers, and our platform funds content providers and publishers who keep the global Internet free and open for everyone.
Handling over 600 billion queries per day (more than 100X the query volume of search globally), our platform operates at unprecedented scale and generates massive amounts of data. We have also built something even stronger and more valuable: an award-winning culture based on trust, empathy, collaboration, and ownership. By working together across typical dividing lines, we are better as a team than any of us could be apart.
Do you have a passion for solving hard problems at scale? Are you eager to join a trust- based, globally-connected team, where your contributions will make a meaningful difference?
Come and see why Fortune Magazine recently named The Trade Desk among the best small to medium-sized workplaces in the US.
WHO WE ARE LOOKING FOR:
You have a sustained track record of making significant, self-directed, and end-to-end contributions to large and impactful machine learning projects. You think beyond just the task at hand to deeply understand the 'why' behind what you are doing.
You are a driver. You will be driving technical projects and providing leadership in a ground-breaking and fast-paced environment. This includes task planning and conducting code reviews, as well as individual code contribution.
You have a strong sense of data intuition. At our scale, many off-the-shelf modeling techniques (open source and enterprise) simply don't work. You are able to work from first principles and intuition to develop solutions and adapt them to a unique environment.
You are a broadly skilled data scientist with experience embedding models into always-on production systems, working across a variety of technologies and data sources.
You have a product-focused mindset. You have the passion and ability to contribute to the process of discovering what will delight our clients and push forward one of the world's largest and most influential industries toward a vision of openness, transparency, and evidence-based decision-making.

You value, seek out, and foster diversity. We are a global team from many diverse backgrounds, with different experiences and perspectives. To complement this team, you will welcome ideas that are different from your own and be skilled at finding and building from common ground.
You are a creative thinker, not bound by ""the way things have always been done."" What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don't need data scientists who know all the answers; we need data scientists who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked.
WHAT YOU WILL BE DOING:
Lead Senior Data Scientists serve both as technical individual contributors and people managers. You will be responsible for owning a technical area as well as building and nurturing a team.
Lead Senior Data Scientists are end-to-end owners. You will participate actively in all aspects of designing, researching, building, and delivering data-focused products for our clients.
Our Data Science team is embedded into nearly a dozen individual, mission-focused engineering teams working across a wide spectrum of technological and scientific challenges.

Lead Senior Data Scientists contribute to more than our product – they build up our team. Through a combination of mentoring, technical leadership, and direct people-management, they make others better and raise the bar for those around them.
WHAT YOU BRING TO THE TABLE:
You have an abundance of intellectual curiosity and are enthusiastic to learn (and teach) new technologies / techniques.
You are you comfortable working on an agile, distributed team spanning multiple time zones and continents.
You are able to communicate effectively across both technical and non-technical audiences.
You have over 10 years of experience working in a data-driven role, including leading large and impactful technical projects.

What and how you can contribute is what's most important to us which is why our consideration is not limited by the level of education you have.
You have experience with big data technologies such as Spark or AWS; are able to write efficient SQL; and are proficient in one or more of the following programming languages: R, Python, Java, or Scala. Variety of technical challenge is one of the best things about working at The Trade Desk as a data scientist though which is why we do not expect you to know every technology we use when you start. What we care about is that you can learn quickly and solve complex problems using the best tools for the job.
The Trade Desk does not accept unsolicited resumes from search firm recruiters. Fees will not be paid in the event a candidate submitted by a recruiter without an agreement in place is hired; such resumes will be deemed the sole property of The Trade Desk.

Handling over 600 billion queries per day (more than 100X the query volume of search globally), our platform operates at unprecedented scale and generates massive amounts of data. We have also built something even stronger and more valuable: an award-winning culture based on trust, empathy, collaboration, and ownership.

Come and see why Fortune Magazine recently named The Trade Desk among the best small to medium-sized workplaces in the US.
WHO WE ARE LOOKING FOR:
Our Senior Data Scientists are end-to-end owners. You will participate actively in all aspects of designing, researching, building, and delivering data-focused products for our clients.
Our Data Science team is embedded into nearly a dozen individual, mission-focused engineering teams working across a wide spectrum of technological and scientific challenges. You will have the opportunity, depending on your interests and background, to work on problems related to natural language processing and machine learning over hundreds of millions of web pages; graph mining and algorithmic optimization on petabytes of data; differential privacy across billions of user IDs; and causal inference with missing data - to name a few.
Senior Data Scientists contribute to more than our product – they build up our team. Through a combination of mentoring and technical leadership, they make others better and raise the bar for those around them.
WHO YOU ARE:
You have a sustained track record of making significant, self-directed, and end-to-end contributions to large and impactful machine learning projects. You think beyond just the task at hand to deeply understand the 'why' behind what you are doing.

You have a strong sense of data intuition. At our scale, many off-the-shelf modeling techniques (open source and enterprise) simply don't work. You are able to work from first principles and intuition to develop solutions and adapt them to a unique environment.

You are a broadly skilled data scientist with experience embedding models into always-on production systems, working across a variety of technologies and data sources.

You have a product-focused mindset. You have the passion and ability to contribute to the process of discovering what will delight our clients and push forward one of the world's largest and most influential industries toward a vision of openness, transparency, and evidence-based decision-making.

You work with confidence and without ego. Our data scientists have deep knowledge and exercise a high degree of leadership in their daily work. You have strongly-held, defensible ideas, and advocate for what you believe is right. You are also adept at identifying and evaluating trade-offs, willing to be proven wrong, and quick to walk through fire to support your fellow teammates.

You value, seek out, and foster diversity. We are a global team from many diverse backgrounds, with different experiences and perspectives. To complement this team, you will welcome ideas that are different from your own and be skilled at finding and building from common ground.

You are a creative thinker, not bound by ""the way things have always been done."" What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don't need data scientists who know all the answers; we need data scientists who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked.

Before the dawn of everything internet, insurance was intimate and personal. You walked down the street to chat with your broker, and the risk to your business, your livelihood, was covered with a handshake. Today things are different. The average insurance policy for a mom-and-pop store trades through a dozen different hands and traverses a maze of systems and processes. Few are accountable and fewer know the whole story.
Some of the problems you will solve entail understanding data, identifying patterns, quantifying the impact of ML / NLP models and designing data visualizations. We seek a data scientist to help drive a new digital AI product team on a mission to unlock the potential of data and identify new opportunities.

The roadmap of projects you’ll work on that tie directly to business goals and objectives.
Manage the entire lifecycle of data projects from strategic planning to tactical activities (data collection, cleanup, analysis, model implementation).
Sourcing new data for a firm that rarely scrapes, pulls or pushes.
Facilitate communication throughout the development process between executive stakeholders, your users and technical teams.
Coordinate and build strong working relations with various internal stakeholder groups, including IT, engineering, and legal.

Caper’s autonomous checkout technology is plug and play, meaning it requires no in-store renovation, no operational overhaul, no heavy computations or endless image labeling. Any retailer can buy the carts and their entire store is upgraded with cashierless capabilities. Caper costs less than 1% of Amazon Go's infrastructure. We are already live in-stores and our customers love us!
Caper is the fastest-growing company in retail automation technology and is backed by Lux Capital, First Round Capital, Y Combinator along with top executives from Google, Walmart, Instacart, Plated, and Albertsons with over $13M in funding to date. While e-commerce accounts for 8% of total retail spending, Caper is innovating the other 92% of the untapped offline retail potential.
As a part of the Caper team, you’ll be a part of a culture that cares about its people and the future we’re shaping together. At Caper, we may all come from different backgrounds, but we all share one common vision - to fundamentally disrupt the retail industry. We are looking for engineers to join our talented technical team.

We Are Cisco
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

Senior Ai Scientist,"New York, NY",Accrete.AI,None,"Location: New York, USA
About Us
We believe that the way humans conduct analytical work will undergo radical transformation over the next several years. Due to an explosion in digital information and cognitive limitations of the human brain, it is impossible for human analysts to capture the true complexity associated with forecasting future events using pre-defined factors. As such, we specialize in building dynamic, continuously learning models that automate complex cognitive tasks typically performed by human analysts. Our mission at Accrete.AI is to scale human expertise and compound the world's knowledge for the purpose of making accurate predictions about the real world that impact financial markets.

We accomplish this by leveraging domain experts to create semantically rich training data on the order of less than 1% of the data from which our models continuously learn. As a result, we are able to produce a non-linear return on the cognitive effort expended by domain experts. Our dynamic continuously learning models, activated by proprietary mathematical functions, underlie an AI platform with a variety of core capabilities including intelligent web crawling, contextual analytics and semantic search. Leveraging these core capabilities, we build smart analytical tools that continuously read, understand and learn in specialized ways. As our smart analytical tools learn, they extract hidden features buried in complexity that surface predictive insights that would be impossible to find using traditional intelligence and tools.

Our products are helping customers generate alpha by identifying and ranking sources most likely to publish reliable, market moving M&A rumors; monitor important shifts in topical nuance based on the interplay between management commentary and analyst questions in earnings transcripts; and monitor patient chatter on the efficacy and safety of clinical drug trials.

"Manager, Associate Product Manager (APM) Program","New York, NY",Schmidt Futures,None,"Schmidt Futures is a philanthropic initiative that finds exceptional people and helps them do more for others together. An emerging priority for Schmidt Futures is the development and placement of technical talent on projects that can drive significant social good. This is for a few reasons:
For those working on a range of challenges – from a famine to healthcare to climate – recruiting top technical talent can be a choke point;
Students and recent graduates are showing growing interest in career paths that allow them to tackle society’s toughest challenges;
Nevertheless, the market for connecting this surging talent to the world’s hardest problems remains broken.
The Associate Product Manager (APM) program is directly filling that gap and allowing us to better understand how to solve this market failure. The program recruits talented young leaders with technical training in computer science, product management, and machine learning to work on high value social impact projects. Over the course of a two-year rotation, APMs work with Schmidt Futures grantees on topics ranging from data-driven criminal justice reform to learning science.
In the first year of the program, we found a surge of interest from young, entrepreneurial people who want to use their skills in the social sector, but who lack pathways to do so. For example, in our first year of recruitment, more than 300 people applied for the program including over 30 percent of the graduating computer science class at Stanford. We made nine offers and all accepted including students with cross-offers in engineering and product roles at major tech companies.
The APM Program is moving into its second year of existence with 17 APMs this Fall. Schmidt Futures is looking for a leader who will take the program from pilot to scale up. This is an ideal role for an entrepreneurial leader who wants to grow a new model to transform the social sector through talent.

Build partnerships with leaders from other philanthropies interested in applying the APM model to their work
Project vetting, selection, and scoping
Set priorities for how to best leverage APM talent towards the highest societal good
Develop a sustainable model for placement of APMs on projects that maximize APM learning and growth as well as “but for” impact on social impact organizations
Work with Schmidt Futures team to identify grantees that would be good fits for an APM and scope projects
Recruitment, training, and coaching for APMs
Work with Schmidt Futures recruitment team to recruit diverse, entrepreneurial cohorts of APMs annually
Provide coaching to APM to help them advance their projects and get feedback to build and improve the program
Drive APM performance evaluation process through collecting feedback on APM performance from partner organizations where they are placed and Schmidt Futures staff

Data Engineer,"New York, NY 10003 (Flatiron District area)",B12,None,"Data Engineering at B12
B12's engineering team views software as a craft, but improving the world as the reason to practice it. Our engineers are responsible for prioritizing, conceptualizing, co-designing, building, testing, and engaging users for any concept we are building out. We're generalists in encouraging each other to experience the full stack, but we're also aware of each other's preferences in the stack. We mentor and teach where we can, both inside and outside of the company.
We value sharing our work with the outside world. Our team has published papers on forming expert flash teams and machine-mediated worker hierarchies. We've baked our research into Orchestra, the system that coordinates our expert and machine teams, and released Orchestra into open source to contribute our software back to the community.
We're looking for a Data Engineer to help us answer critical questions our business faces while improving our data systems and architecture to support greater variety, volume, and velocity of data and data sources. We hope our engineers have more longevity than any one tool we use, but here is a sampling of our current thoughts about technology:
We build our product on Python/Django and JavaScript/React.
We store blobs in Amazon's S3, munch on them in Amazon's EC2, develop in Docker, and deploy containers to Amazon's Elastic Beanstalk.
We believe Postgres should be the first system you consider when you think about persisting structured data.
We religiously clean and centralize data in Amazon's Redshift, and are able to answer most any question in SQL. We recently wrote our 1000th query in Metabase!
Before building complex statistical machine learning models, we build simple ones we can understand. Rarely, we build complex models.
We have near-full test coverage on the backend, and are making progress on our frontend and integration tests.
We set up continuous integration and deployment because, while this model comes with its own pains, we've disliked being on fixed release schedules on previous projects.
We like to move fast and support point-in-time recovery :).
As a Data Engineer, you will
Collaborate with operational teams including sales, marketing, and customer success.
Contribute to infrastructure that enables and informs B12's analytical efforts.
Write SQL queries and reusable views that enable various analyses including funnel, retention, and performance reporting.
Use Python to clean data, send it to various systems including our data warehouse and operational services, and perform feature engineering to power the creation of predictive models.
Build rules-based models and statistical machine learning models in Python using packages like scikit-learn.
You'd be a good fit if
You are fluent in SQL and Python.
You have experience building and using data infrastructure, including systems like Postgres and Redshift.
You've used reporting tools like Metabase, Tableau, or Looker in the past.
You know that no dataset is ever pristine, but love to interrogate, structure, and clean data.
You've contributed to extract-transform-load pipelines to collect data from disparate sources and centralize them in a data warehouse.
You feel comfortable managing your time and deciding amongst competing priorities.
You have worked with non-engineering teams and are comfortable explaining technical solutions to them.
You are passionate about the future of work.
You enjoy learning and teaching.
You have strong written and verbal communication skills in English.
You care about and want to contribute to our mission of helping people do meaningful work.
Don't fear
We don't have a minimum number of years of experience for this role. We highly favor talent and interest.
Some candidates may see this list and feel discouraged because they don't match all the items. Please apply anyway: there's a good chance you're more wonderful than you think you are.
B12 is a safe place for human beings.

Why Cisco
# WeAreCisco , where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool.

Senior Data Scientist,"New York, NY",Pivotal Software,None,"About Us VIDEO
Founded in 2013, Pivotal Software, Inc. combines our leading cloud-native platform, tools, and methodology to empower the world's largest organizations to adapt to change and build great software. Our technology unleashes developer productivity, while fulfilling our mission to transform how the world builds software.
You
As a data scientist on Pivotal's Data Science team, you'll be working on a wide variety of data problems for a diverse range of clients. You will often be asked to learn new technologies and domains on the fly. You should be comfortable working under deadlines and making tough decisions. Consequently, you will frequently have to balance achieving an immediate goal with scalability and productionalizability.
The role offers room for personal and professional growth, and you won't be working in isolation. Data Science at Pivotal is an encouraging and supportive team, where ideas and challenges are addressed collaboratively. We're looking for the kind of person who will try and solve a problem on their own first, but isn't afraid to ask for help or say ""I don't know.""
Us
The Data Science team at Pivotal is primarily a consulting practice; we are tool agnostic, working with our customers to solve real world problems. Our customers, like us, are cross-disciplinary. We service engagements with use cases running from customer churn to optimization to detecting fraud and misconduct. We are not just doers, we are also educators and enablers.
Your Day
While there is no such thing as a ""typical day"", these are activities we frequently find ourselves doing:
Working with clients to uncover and frame new opportunities for data science. Clients often come to us without a clear understanding of what we can do, so this is our chance to open their eyes to new possibilities for their businesses.
Exploring client datasets, looking for actionable insights we can present.
Engineering features, training models, tuning hyperparameters and evaluating the results. We emphasize rigor, because data science done right at this stage leads to models that shine in production.
Taking the models we build into production. This is an exciting stage for anyone who likes collaborating with engineering teams and seeing their model become real when users interact with it.
Helping our clients develop their internal data science practices, from hiring and recruiting to data capturing, so that they can be successful when we hand off the project.
Required Skills / Experiences
Clear and empathetic communicator. You'll be the one sharing your insights with clients and stakeholders at check-ins, documenting your work, and even explaining your model to client data teams as part of a handoff. As such, communication and empathy are essential parts of your toolkit.
Advanced knowledge of statistical modeling and/or machine learning methods. These are the tools we need to go from analysis to prediction.
Strong programming skills. Left to our own devices most of us work in Python, but learning the client's tech stack is an important part of the job.
Strong exploratory data analysis skills. Every engagement starts with an investigation of the data, and thorough EDA saves us a lot of headaches in the long run.
Some travel is expected, depending on location and skillset. We mostly work out of the Pivotal office closest to the client, but sometimes we have to be on site for an extended period of time.
At least a bachelor's degree in an analytical or technical field. This could be applied mathematics, statistics, computer science, operations research, economics, etc. Higher education welcome and encouraged.
This role will support US government clients that require US citizenship. Given this, US citizenship is required for you to apply.
Desired Skills / Experiences
2+ years of work in a data-centric field (data science or data engineering).
Experience with relational databases.
Exposure and experience working in a Linux environment.
You have a specialization in an area like NLP, optimization, or image processing.
Hands-on experience working in a distributed computing environment or proven theoretical understanding of parallelism.
Pivotal is an Equal Employment Opportunity employer that will consider all qualified applicants, regardless of race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, marital status, gender identity or expression, national origin, genetics, age, disability status, protected veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by applicable law."

That growth has been entirely through word of mouth – we have never spent on ads. We have millions of active users, have raised $6m, and just launched our second paid feature.

For thousands of years, astrology has functioned as social glue, giving people the tools to reflect and connect in real, meaningful ways. Co–Star is bringing astrology into the 21st century with an app people call their “best friend,’ compare to ""a board meeting with your best friend, your boss, your mother, and the universe,"" and that therapists recommend to their clients.

Astrology is a deterministic system based on the time it takes a planet to orbit the sun. It's more like folk developmental psychology than it is like fortune cookies. Using NASA data interpreted by humans, Co–Star delivers personalized readings in real time. Our AI strings human-written snippets together to generate hyper-personalized interpretations of planetary movements for millions of people.

What you’ll do
Architect and build our Haskell backend with well-documented, easily-tested code that can gracefully scale to tens of millions of users.
Build an elegant system that takes the infinite complexity of human language, gives our writers tools for expressive composition, and delivers relevant horoscopes to users using aggregated contextual & historical signals.
Use machines to automate a wide variety of repetitive tasks, including some (not all) writing.
Work extremely closely with a small, cross-functional team to negotiate, build, and ship new features with the best bang for our buck.
You may be a good fit for this role if you have:
Hands-on experience writing in Haskell or other functional programming languages using modern architecture paradigms
Developed, scaled, and maintained complex web apps on cloud infrastructure (especially AWS)
A disciplined approach to development, testing, documentation, and code structure in a team environment
3+ years of experience and strong CS fundamentals
Experience in ML and NLP, particularly libraries like spaCy, GPT-2, and BERT, is a plus

THE ENVIRONMENT

We use Python, Haskell, AWS, BigQuery, Swift, and Kotlin. We’re big into cross-functional collaboration. We ideate collectively, ship qualitatively-validated MVPs, and iterate based on internal & customer feedback. We validate what we think people need with iterative user testing, A/B test everything, and use data to inform our decisions. Weekly, the whole team talks through why tests worked or failed. Monthly, the entire company comes together to think of what we want to build.

BENEFITS
Fully covered $0 deductible healthcare (including vision + dental)
Unlimited vacation
Flexible hours
Competitive cash + equity comp
Unlimited equipment budget

ABOUT CO–STAR

Two years in, Co–Star has millions of monthly actives and we’ve raised $6,000,000 from the people behind companies like Glossier, Rent the Runway, eBay, Periscope, and Everlane.

Senior Software Engineer - Compliance Platform,"New York, NY",Bloomberg,None,"You've seen the headlines. Financial firms are fined millions of dollars when just one employee does something they shouldn't. It can be as serious as insider trading or as seemingly innocent as an inappropriate instant message. Keeping track of who is saying, doing, and trading what is a daunting task for compliance officers, especially with the explosion in the volume and variety of data produced by communications and trading platforms.
That’s where Bloomberg Compliance comes in. Comprised of Bloomberg Vault Archive and Bloomberg Surveillance, Bloomberg Vault provides a single platform for compliant storage and reconstruction of our customer’s communication, collaboration, and financial transaction data. More than 1,000 organizations use Bloomberg Vault to manage and archive their enterprise communications and collaboration data, including email, instant message (IM), mobile, files, trade and documents, voice data and social media. Our multi-tenant cloud processes 300 million messages daily and stores about 90 billion archived objects, and we are looking to grow significantly in the next two years.
Bloomberg’s Surveillance Platform is a mission critical product used by key risk owners and compliance officers globally to meet the strict regulatory requirements in the financial world. At its core is a policy-driven engine capable of evaluating communications content and metadata in real-time and identifies interactions that would fall into questionable behavior on clients and custom reports. The engine is deployed on Vault's private cloud and is capable of processing tens of thousands of events per second as they are meticulously designed using high performance frameworks: Storm, Kafka, Spark, and Redis among others.
As part of our team, you will be responsible for the Surveillance real-time policy engine and all capture systems for live traffic from Bloomberg Terminal communications and ingested third party content (emails, instant messages, social media feed, etc). Our truly unique role is building sophisticated preventative analytics (e.g. anti-money laundering, bribery, etc.) over enterprise wide communications, while using advanced techniques in ML and NLP fields in our engines.

Software Engineer,"New York, NY 10013 (SoHo area)",Carta,None,"Come help us build the Carta Investor Experience
We’re looking for a talented engineer to join our team in the Investor Services business unit.
The Company You’ll Join
At Carta we create owners and make private markets liquid.
We live in a world where some people live on the equity stack and enjoy exponential wealth growth and preferential tax treatment; others live on the debt stack and may work their entire lives for a company and retire only with the cash they’ve managed to save from their paychecks. Our contribution to solving the wealth inequality problem is moving people from the debt stack (payroll) to the equity stack. By making it as easy to issue equity to employees as it is to put them on payroll, we can create more owners.
At Carta, we are helpful, transparent, fair, and kind. We are relentless executors, unconventional thinkers, and masters of our craft.
To learn more, here is what one of our investors wrote about leading our Series
The Team You’ll Work With
The team you’ll join is the Enable team within Investor Services. We’re in charge of the first impression our customers have of Carta and setting them up for success down the road. It’s a big responsibility and we relish the challenge. It requires curiosity, grit, collaboration, and incisive thinking; and we’ve got those in spades. Our team nurtures open minded exploration and cares about outcomes over output. We measure success not by features shipped or lines of code written, but rather by the impact we drive for the business.
We are Carson, Jeff, Ashley, Julian, Jess, Jun, Mallik, Leo. In our spare time, we’re working on setting up a live stream of Momo (Jess’s new cat, who makes frequent Zoom appearances).
The Problems You’ll Solve
Our Fund Admin business has grown really quickly, so this year we’ve taken on big projects to understand and standardize data for the customers we work with. We’re solving the problem of accurately modeling the world in our software. We believe this is the key to turning our service business into a product business. We’re really excited to start building on top of our new foundation the rest of this year.
Some of the problems you’ll help us solve are:
How do you untangle dependencies and design an extensible architecture that increases development velocity and reduces bugs?
How do you model unstructured data and relationships in the venture capital ecosystem to help scale the business into new, more complex markets?
How do you design a multi-sided platform that fosters collaboration across many user types each with different goals and contexts?
The Impact You’ll Have
If we can solve these problems, we will be setting up our customers, our business, and our industry for long term success. Our customers will see accurate data, understand their accounts, and make better investment decisions. Our onboarding team will be able to spend their time delivering white glove service rather than doing manual data entry. Our business teams will be able to expand into new, more complex markets based on our foundational work.
The final result of our efforts will be an accurate graph of the venture capital network. On top of this graph we will build the financial products of the future: instant investment funds, next-gen banking products, and a stock exchange. Without this graph capital markets may stay stuck in the middle ages.
About You
You want to help solve problems that are big and meaty. You like untangling messy balls of yarn. You do so by digging deep and seeking to understand - the business, the users, the product, and the technology. You reflect and strive to master your craft. You measure yourself by the impact you drive for the business and for the company. You seek to serve - our customers, our company, and our team. You like working with a team bound by a common purpose.

Associate Research Scholar (Data) Brown Institute,"New York, NY 10027 (Manhattanville area)",Columbia University,None,"The David and Helen Gurley Brown Institute for Media Innovation was founded in 2012 and is a joint effort between Stanford’s School of Engineering and Columbia Journalism School (CJS). Each year, the Brown Institute awards close to $1M in grants and fellowships to foster new tools and modes of expression, and to create stories that escape the bounds of page and screen. We are committed to radical experimentation with the potential to define new priorities and practices for both engineering and journalism.
The Brown Institute at CJS is seeking a Research Scholar (open rank) to serve as a data specialist in support the Institute’s research and grants. This person will play both a high-level role reporting directly to the Director of the Institute at Columbia, helping provide data expertise and assistance to the Institute’s various grant and fellowship programs, as well as assisting in the implementation of seminars and workshops that engage the CJS and Columbia University (CU) communities in data-related topics.
The primary function of the Institute is to serve as a grant making organization. As such, the Institute has funded over 50 projects, supporting well over 150 grantees and fellows. Due to our position as a joint venture between Stanford Engineering and Columbia Journalism School, as well as seismic shifts in the journalism industry that have led many organizations to focus heavily on data and computation, many of our projects are rooted in data-based storytelling. In our 2019-2020 Magic Grant cycle alone, the Brown Institute at Columbia is explicitly supporting three projects that are essentially database research endeavours. One project, for example, is focused on acquiring and aggregating human rights violations in Pakistan to enable better reporting on the country. Another project is focused on producing a comprehensive database of maternal deaths in Nigeria, as well as providing systematic assessment of the efficacy of health interventions in the country. And yet another project is developing an automated database of the Trump administration’s 3000+ current and former appointees, enabling journalists to report on stories about appointees’ interests and potential conflicts, and how those impact policymaking.
The Research Scholar will be the lead data scientist for these projects — creating databases from possibly unstructured information; designing systems for the ingest, automation, and cleaning of future data; and helping journalists pull stories from the data. In addition to grants and fellowships, the Institute offers a number of pedagogical programs, from simple open office hours on topics like Data Visualization and Mapping, to seminars and conferences about the role of data in journalism. The Research Scholar will have the opportunity to assist in these efforts, helping design and lead workshops, provide office hours to the school, and work on personal projects that align with the mission of the Institute. This is an exciting new role that will leverage the incredible grants we have funded, as well as our connections to industry and to the academic environment in which we exist.
These tasks mean that the Research Scholar should have a firm grounding in all things data. Applicants should be fluent in at least one programming language, preferably Python or R, and should have a history of learning new technological platforms as well as a general curiosity about how technology might shape narrative. The Research Scholar will also be encouraged to seek out and develop their own novel data projects, and might also teach a course in the CJS, with the goal of promoting the mix of data and journalism in new ways.
This position will be appointed for up to 12 months, may be renewable contingent on performance and the continued availability of funding.

"Software Engineer, Investor Enablement","New York, NY 10013 (SoHo area)",Carta,None,"Come help us build the Carta Investor Experience
We're looking for a talented engineer to join our team in the Investor Services business unit.
The Company You'll Join
At Carta we create owners and make private markets liquid.
We live in a world where some people live on the equity stack and enjoy exponential wealth growth and preferential tax treatment; others live on the debt stack and may work their entire lives for a company and retire only with the cash they've managed to save from their paychecks. Our contribution to solving the wealth inequality problem is moving people from the debt stack (payroll) to the equity stack. By making it as easy to issue equity to employees as it is to put them on payroll, we can create more owners.
At Carta, we are helpful, transparent, fair, and kind. We are relentless executors, unconventional thinkers, and masters of our craft.
To learn more, here is what one of our investors wrote about leading our Series
The Team You'll Work With
The team you'll join is the Enable team within Investor Services. We're in charge of the first impression our customers have of Carta and setting them up for success down the road. It's a big responsibility and we relish the challenge. It requires curiosity, grit, collaboration, and incisive thinking; and we've got those in spades. Our team nurtures open minded exploration and cares about outcomes over output. We measure success not by features shipped or lines of code written, but rather by the impact we drive for the business.
We are Carson, Jeff, Ashley, Julian, Jess, Jun, Mallik, Leo. In our spare time, we're working on setting up a live stream of Momo (Jess's new cat, who makes frequent Zoom appearances).
The Problems You'll Solve
Our Fund Admin business has grown really quickly, so this year we've taken on big projects to understand and standardize data for the customers we work with. We're solving the problem of accurately modeling the world in our software. We believe this is the key to turning our service business into a product business. We're really excited to start building on top of our new foundation the rest of this year.
Some of the problems you'll help us solve are:
How do you untangle dependencies and design an extensible architecture that increases development velocity and reduces bugs?
How do you model unstructured data and relationships in the venture capital ecosystem to help scale the business into new, more complex markets?
How do you design a multi-sided platform that fosters collaboration across many user types each with different goals and contexts?
The Impact You'll Have
If we can solve these problems, we will be setting up our customers, our business, and our industry for long term success. Our customers will see accurate data, understand their accounts, and make better investment decisions. Our onboarding team will be able to spend their time delivering white glove service rather than doing manual data entry. Our business teams will be able to expand into new, more complex markets based on our foundational work.
The final result of our efforts will be an accurate graph of the venture capital network. On top of this graph we will build the financial products of the future: instant investment funds, next-gen banking products, and a stock exchange. Without this graph capital markets may stay stuck in the middle ages.
About You
You want to help solve problems that are big and meaty. You like untangling messy balls of yarn. You do so by digging deep and seeking to understand - the business, the users, the product, and the technology. You reflect and strive to master your craft. You measure yourself by the impact you drive for the business and for the company. You seek to serve - our customers, our company, and our team. You like working with a team bound by a common purpose.
The Interview Process
We are an equal opportunity employer and are committed to providing a positive interview experience for every candidate. If accommodations due to a disability or medical condition are needed, connect with us via email at recruiting@carta.com. As a company, we value fairness, helpfulness, transparency, leadership and build our teams around these values.

To Apply:
The first stage of the process is the application below. In order to be considered, you must submit an application that consists of all four components: 1 - Resume, 2 - Cover letter, 3 - Evidence of student learning, and 4 -Original Curricular tool. The requirements for each of the four components are specified in detail below.
1. RESUME: Please submit an up-to-date resume.
2. COVER LETTER: Please submit a well-written cover letter. Please include information about your experience teaching Physical Education to kindergarten students.
3. EVIDENCE OF STUDENT LEARNING: Submit one of the following three options:
Option A: NEW (DUE TO COVID-19 SCHOOL CLOSURES)
We understand you may be unable to provide a recorded video of you teaching in a classroom setting. If you do not have a video with students in the classroom (per the instructions below) you may still submit a video of yourself teaching. Get creative! You may include a video of you teaching (a) a lesson with/for no students, (b) a lesson of you teaching family members, (c) or a lesson for students virtually. We're excited to see your creativity. The video must be accompanied by a written narrative that analyzes and reflects upon the teaching that occurs in the lesson. There is no minimum or maximum length for the narrative. The video may be submitted in any format, but a link to a video posted online is preferred.
An unedited video clip (maximum 15 minutes) of you teaching in a classroom setting (preferred) or a small-group setting. It is preferred that the students be in the same grade-level as the TEP teaching position for which you are applying, though this is not a strict requirement. The video may contain only one continuous, unedited clip (i.e. do not splice together multiple clips from different points in the lesson). The clip does not need to show an entire lesson; a brief lesson segment is perfectly acceptable. The video must be accompanied by a written narrative that analyzes and reflects upon the teaching and learning that occurs in the lesson and may offer an explanation as to what occurred prior to and subsequent to the clip. There is no minimum or maximum length for the narrative. The video may be submitted in any format, but a link to a video posted online is preferred.
Option B: A portfolio of student work that demonstrates the progress of at least two specific students that you have taught. The portfolio must contain a minimum of two work products for each student (for a minimum of four work products) completed at different points in time during the period when each student was in your class. The portfolio must be accompanied by a written narrative that analyzes and reflects upon the progress that each student demonstrates. There is no minimum or maximum length for the narrative.
Option C: Assessment data for at least one entire class of students that you have taught. The assessments may be standardized national, state, or city assessments or your own self-created assessments. The assessment data can be provided in any form that you choose (official documents with students' last names crossed-out, or documents that you create to summarize student assessment performance). The data you provide should ideally show progress over time; as such, it is recommended (though not required) that you provide data for at least two assessments taken at different points in time. The assessment data must be accompanied by a copy of the assessments themselves. If a specific assessment is unavailable, provide a copy of a similar assessment. The assessment data must also be accompanied by a written narrative that provides background on the assessments, explains how the assessments measure student performance, and analyzes the results of your class. There is no minimum or maximum length for the narrative.
4. ORIGINAL CURRICULAR TOOL: Please submit one original curricular tool of any form that you have personally developed. The requirement here is deliberately open-ended because we are interested in seeing anything that you have developed that you believe has meaningfully supported your students' learning. This may take the form of written materials, a unique instructional methodology, a technological innovation, etc.
