ABOUT GLEAN (currently in stealth mode)
Glean is injecting intelligence into expense management. Founded by fintech veteran and seasoned CFO Howard Katzenberg, Glean is an AI-powered spend intelligence solution that saves SMBs money by analyzing expense drivers and finding line-item level insights overlooked by most accounts payable solutions, which are focused on speeding up payment cycles rather than optimizing vendor spend.
Over time, our mission is to become the all-in-one spend management solution for SMBs that uses AI to: analyze spend, manage approval and payment workflows, identify anomalous spend & savings opportunities, benchmark spend performance vs. peers, find & negotiate savings with vendors, and forecast future expense trends.
Glean will be every finance team’s best friend!
Join us!
ABOUT THIS ROLE
We are building the next billion-dollar business in enterprise SAAS. We have an amazing founding team, with experts in product, engineering, data science, and machine learning, and we just launched our MVP. We are now searching for a data scientist that will own the core data science work, build NLP applications, and generate insights.
After we ingest PDFs from clients, we perform OCR, extract the text using text classification models, validate the extraction with a human in the loop, and then map all the data into our canonical taxonomy.
Once the data is mapped to our taxonomy, we have a clean digital invoice-based data asset. We generate insights using this data asset, surfacing line-item level insights to our clients via our web app.
Your role will be critical to generating this intelligence for our clients.
Here are some of the major items you will own at Glean:
Data science code to clean and prepare the data extracted from invoices, including handling nulls, addressing exceptions, imputing data (when possible), and enriching data using third-party APIs
Data science code to validate the goodness of extractions performed by the ML models + human in the loop
Collaborate with vendors to perform OCR and text classification
Develop NLP models to map the extracted data to our canonical taxonomy of vendors and line items (e.g., using word embeddings, etc.) at scale
Once the data has been mapped to the canonical taxonomy, perform feature engineering, generate insights, detect anomalies, and surface the intelligence in a digestible format to the end user
You will work closely with the data engineers to productionize the data science and machine learning code that is developed, and you will work closely with the engineering team to make sure the data science and machine learning pipelines are performant in production.
You’ll be accountable for Glean’s:
Data science vision – ownership over and definition of the data science pipeline, working closely with the executive team, and acting as a thought leader across the company
Technical execution – define, articulate, and execute the data science strategy from launch to scale, managing the day-to-day execution, and implementing best practices
Fast prototyping culture – Develop data science and machine learning applications fast, prototyping quickly to solve thorny business problems without getting bogged down in theory (ship early and often)
Getting your hands dirty - we’re a small team and we have a lot of work ahead of us. You should be excited to roll up your sleeves and help the team in any way you can
Build, build, build – jumping in and writing data science code, from architecture to fixing bugs, delivering NLP and insights within the three months of hire. We'll rely on you and your team to handle day-to-day execution including:
Cleaning the extracted data, validating the accuracy of the extraction, and addressing issues as they occur
Shipping NLP applications to perform mapping of extracted data at scale
Developing and deploying models using PyTorch or TensorFlow
Writing code using PySpark
Performing feature engineering on the cleansed and mapped data
Generating insights and narratives
Performing anomaly detection to surface what the client needs to know fast
Wrangling, standardizing, enhancing, implementing, and monitoring data repositories
Creating workflows to ingest, enrich, and make data available across the Glean platform
PERFECT FIT
You’ll be a perfect fit for the Glean Team if…
You want to join an early-stage startup or you are extremely anxious to be challenged at your first startup
You like the tension between craft and shipping. You have strong ability to quickly and effectively evaluate technical tradeoffs and translate them into short/long term business decisions
You’ve built highly scalable data pipelines and have deep expertise in setting technical vision, architecting, building, and maintaining performant systems, from launch to scale
You are passionate about building / leading data science teams and rapidly developing data pipelines at various stages of growth
You pride yourself in communicating complex concepts, including the ability to distill intricate workflows and systems into clear processes and decisions with measurable company-wide impact
You ask “why” a lot and use critical thinking and data to back up your intuitions. You hate when a customer struggles through your product experience
You have managed a budget before and have seen first-hand the challenges in managing vendor spend

You have a strong sense of data intuition. At our scale, many off-the-shelf modeling techniques (open source and enterprise) simply don't work. You are able to work from first principles and intuition to develop solutions and adapt them to a unique environment.
You are a broadly skilled data scientist with experience embedding models into always-on production systems, working across a variety of technologies and data sources.
You have a product-focused mindset. You have the passion and ability to contribute to the process of discovering what will delight our clients and push forward one of the world's largest and most influential industries toward a vision of openness, transparency, and evidence-based decision-making.
You work with confidence and without ego. Our data scientists have deep knowledge and exercise a high degree of leadership in their daily work. You have strongly-held, defensible ideas, and advocate for what you believe is right. You are also adept at identifying and evaluating trade-offs, willing to be proven wrong, and quick to walk through fire to support your fellow teammates.
You value, seek out, and foster diversity. We are a global team from many diverse backgrounds, with different experiences and perspectives. To complement this team, you will welcome ideas that are different from your own and be skilled at finding and building from common ground.
You are a creative thinker, not bound by ""the way things have always been done."" What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don't need data scientists who know all the answers; we need data scientists who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked.
WHAT YOU WILL BE DOING:
Lead Senior Data Scientists serve both as technical individual contributors and people managers. You will be responsible for owning a technical area as well as building and nurturing a team.
Lead Senior Data Scientists are end-to-end owners. You will participate actively in all aspects of designing, researching, building, and delivering data-focused products for our clients.
Our Data Science team is embedded into nearly a dozen individual, mission-focused engineering teams working across a wide spectrum of technological and scientific challenges. You will have the opportunity, depending on your interests and background, to own problems related to natural language processing and machine learning over hundreds of millions of web pages, graph mining and algorithmic optimization on petabytes of data, and causal inference with missing data - to name a few.
Lead Senior Data Scientists contribute to more than our product – they build up our team. Through a combination of mentoring, technical leadership, and direct people-management, they make others better and raise the bar for those around them.
WHAT YOU BRING TO THE TABLE:
You have an abundance of intellectual curiosity and are enthusiastic to learn (and teach) new technologies / techniques.
You are you comfortable working on an agile, distributed team spanning multiple time zones and continents.
You are able to communicate effectively across both technical and non-technical audiences.
You have over 10 years of experience working in a data-driven role, including leading large and impactful technical projects. You may have an advanced degree in a quantitative field, but it's not a requirement. What and how you can contribute is what's most important to us which is why our consideration is not limited by the level of education you have.
You have experience with big data technologies such as Spark or AWS; are able to write efficient SQL; and are proficient in one or more of the following programming languages: R, Python, Java, or Scala. Variety of technical challenge is one of the best things about working at The Trade Desk as a data scientist though which is why we do not expect you to know every technology we use when you start. What we care about is that you can learn quickly and solve complex problems using the best tools for the job.
The Trade Desk does not accept unsolicited resumes from search firm recruiters. Fees will not be paid in the event a candidate submitted by a recruiter without an agreement in place is hired; such resumes will be deemed the sole property of The Trade Desk. The Trade Desk is an equal opportunity employer. All aspects of employment will be based on merit, competence, performance, and business needs. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, marital status, age, national origin, ancestry, physical or mental disability, medical condition, pregnancy, genetic information, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, veteran status, or any other status protected under federal, state, or local law."

We Are Cisco
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

Senior Ai Scientist,"New York, NY",Accrete.AI,None,"Location: New York, USA
About Us
We believe that the way humans conduct analytical work will undergo radical transformation over the next several years. Due to an explosion in digital information and cognitive limitations of the human brain, it is impossible for human analysts to capture the true complexity associated with forecasting future events using pre-defined factors. As such, we specialize in building dynamic, continuously learning models that automate complex cognitive tasks typically performed by human analysts. Our mission at Accrete.AI is to scale human expertise and compound the world's knowledge for the purpose of making accurate predictions about the real world that impact financial markets.

We accomplish this by leveraging domain experts to create semantically rich training data on the order of less than 1% of the data from which our models continuously learn. As a result, we are able to produce a non-linear return on the cognitive effort expended by domain experts. Our dynamic continuously learning models, activated by proprietary mathematical functions, underlie an AI platform with a variety of core capabilities including intelligent web crawling, contextual analytics and semantic search. Leveraging these core capabilities, we build smart analytical tools that continuously read, understand and learn in specialized ways. As our smart analytical tools learn, they extract hidden features buried in complexity that surface predictive insights that would be impossible to find using traditional intelligence and tools.

Our products are helping customers generate alpha by identifying and ranking sources most likely to publish reliable, market moving M&A rumors; monitor important shifts in topical nuance based on the interplay between management commentary and analyst questions in earnings transcripts; and monitor patient chatter on the efficacy and safety of clinical drug trials.

Based in Lower Manhattan, Accrete has a majority interest in NYC based Shinrai, an AI Services subsidiary.

There is a staggering opportunity for improving the efficiency of current manufacturing processes, and enabling the next generation of manufacturing through the effective gathering, analysis, and productionization of data and insights. Oden is driving this revolution.
We have a combined edge-cloud solution, large-scale data processing architectures, and advanced machine learning algorithms within the Oden platform so all manufacturers can monitor, analyze and optimize their production, across their diverse set of processes. Our goal is to democratize efficiency, sustainability, and competitiveness in the manufacturing domain.
Why We Do It:
We like to enable those who make things - to make more, to waste less, to serve their customers, and to thrive in a competitive world. Help enough makers, and the world can give us all the abundance we want for less cost and environmental impact. We’re on the verge of a 4th industrial revolution for everyone who makes things.
You:
Care about the purpose of the product and the company.
You are never satisfied with the way things are, but excited about the way things could be.

Experience with ML workflows for modeling large data sets (bonus: experience with time-series data, with real-time data analysis)
Enthusiasm to own projects end-to-end; from experimentation to customer delivery
What We Offer You:
Measurable impact on the world and the chance to help real people - family businesses, entrepreneurs, engineers.
Exposure to many tech disciplines, most of which are rapidly evolving.
A bridge between the physical and cloud worlds of tech. Our platform unites big data visualizations with sensors, M2M tech, and heavy industrial equipment.
A platform that has the potential to evolve beyond what we have envisioned now.
Scientific and transparent thinking, for everyone involved.
Backing by world leaders of both industry and tech that will ensure long term growth and development for us.

We’re an equal opportunity employer (EOE).
Diversity at Oden means building a team that is rich across all boundaries of race, ethnicity, gender identification, sexual orientation, disability, religion, age and thinking style. We welcome all backgrounds, life experiences, and worldviews as this is the catalyst for the rapid evolution of our product and our organization. Diversity allows us to tackle new challenges, embrace change, make well-informed decisions, and ultimately Make Things Better. In alignment with our “People First” company value, Oden has a passionate internal team dedicated to the promotion of diversity and inclusion initiatives as a core component of our culture.

"Manager, Associate Product Manager (APM) Program","New York, NY",Schmidt Futures,None,"Schmidt Futures is a philanthropic initiative that finds exceptional people and helps them do more for others together. An emerging priority for Schmidt Futures is the development and placement of technical talent on projects that can drive significant social good. This is for a few reasons:
For those working on a range of challenges – from a famine to healthcare to climate – recruiting top technical talent can be a choke point;
Students and recent graduates are showing growing interest in career paths that allow them to tackle society’s toughest challenges;
Nevertheless, the market for connecting this surging talent to the world’s hardest problems remains broken.
The Associate Product Manager (APM) program is directly filling that gap and allowing us to better understand how to solve this market failure. The program recruits talented young leaders with technical training in computer science, product management, and machine learning to work on high value social impact projects. Over the course of a two-year rotation, APMs work with Schmidt Futures grantees on topics ranging from data-driven criminal justice reform to learning science.
In the first year of the program, we found a surge of interest from young, entrepreneurial people who want to use their skills in the social sector, but who lack pathways to do so. For example, in our first year of recruitment, more than 300 people applied for the program including over 30 percent of the graduating computer science class at Stanford. We made nine offers and all accepted including students with cross-offers in engineering and product roles at major tech companies.
The APM Program is moving into its second year of existence with 17 APMs this Fall. Schmidt Futures is looking for a leader who will take the program from pilot to scale up. This is an ideal role for an entrepreneurial leader who wants to grow a new model to transform the social sector through talent.

Recruitment, training, and coaching for APMs
Work with Schmidt Futures recruitment team to recruit diverse, entrepreneurial cohorts of APMs annually
Provide coaching to APM to help them advance their projects and get feedback to build and improve the program
Drive APM performance evaluation process through collecting feedback on APM performance from partner organizations where they are placed and Schmidt Futures staff

Our culture is rooted in organizational transparency, empowering individuals, and an attitude of getting things done. If you want to be a valuable contributor on a team that champions these core values, we would love to hear from you.
The Role
The Client Solutions Analyst (CSA) is the foundation of Simon Data's Client Solutions Team, providing deep and responsive technical and client service to facilitate utilization of the Simon Data Platform.

Data Engineer,"New York, NY 10003 (Flatiron District area)",B12,None,"Data Engineering at B12
B12's engineering team views software as a craft, but improving the world as the reason to practice it. Our engineers are responsible for prioritizing, conceptualizing, co-designing, building, testing, and engaging users for any concept we are building out. We're generalists in encouraging each other to experience the full stack, but we're also aware of each other's preferences in the stack. We mentor and teach where we can, both inside and outside of the company.
We value sharing our work with the outside world. Our team has published papers on forming expert flash teams and machine-mediated worker hierarchies. We've baked our research into Orchestra, the system that coordinates our expert and machine teams, and released Orchestra into open source to contribute our software back to the community.
We're looking for a Data Engineer to help us answer critical questions our business faces while improving our data systems and architecture to support greater variety, volume, and velocity of data and data sources. We hope our engineers have more longevity than any one tool we use, but here is a sampling of our current thoughts about technology:
We build our product on Python/Django and JavaScript/React.
We store blobs in Amazon's S3, munch on them in Amazon's EC2, develop in Docker, and deploy containers to Amazon's Elastic Beanstalk.
We believe Postgres should be the first system you consider when you think about persisting structured data.
We religiously clean and centralize data in Amazon's Redshift, and are able to answer most any question in SQL. We recently wrote our 1000th query in Metabase!
Before building complex statistical machine learning models, we build simple ones we can understand. Rarely, we build complex models.
We have near-full test coverage on the backend, and are making progress on our frontend and integration tests.
We set up continuous integration and deployment because, while this model comes with its own pains, we've disliked being on fixed release schedules on previous projects.
We like to move fast and support point-in-time recovery :).
As a Data Engineer, you will
Collaborate with operational teams including sales, marketing, and customer success.
Contribute to infrastructure that enables and informs B12's analytical efforts.
Write SQL queries and reusable views that enable various analyses including funnel, retention, and performance reporting.
Use Python to clean data, send it to various systems including our data warehouse and operational services, and perform feature engineering to power the creation of predictive models.
Build rules-based models and statistical machine learning models in Python using packages like scikit-learn.
You'd be a good fit if
You are fluent in SQL and Python.
You have experience building and using data infrastructure, including systems like Postgres and Redshift.
You've used reporting tools like Metabase, Tableau, or Looker in the past.
You know that no dataset is ever pristine, but love to interrogate, structure, and clean data.
You've contributed to extract-transform-load pipelines to collect data from disparate sources and centralize them in a data warehouse.
You feel comfortable managing your time and deciding amongst competing priorities.
You have worked with non-engineering teams and are comfortable explaining technical solutions to them.
You are passionate about the future of work.
You enjoy learning and teaching.
You have strong written and verbal communication skills in English.
You care about and want to contribute to our mission of helping people do meaningful work.
Don't fear
We don't have a minimum number of years of experience for this role. We highly favor talent and interest.
Some candidates may see this list and feel discouraged because they don't match all the items. Please apply anyway: there's a good chance you're more wonderful than you think you are.

Why Cisco
# WeAreCisco , where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool.

About Us
Pinto is a smarter food data platform, designed for the needs of today's consumers in the world of personalized diet. To do this, we're rapidly bringing the world of food online and making it personalized across every dietary need and preference — everything from general diets like Vegan, Paleo, Keto, Heart Health, and Mediterranean, to the long tail of ingredient and allergen considerations like Lactose Free, Gluten Free, Nut Free, and No Added Sugars. Over 40% of Americans now follow a specific dietary eating pattern, and our data platform is organizing the world of food at scale with partners that include Whole Foods and Kroger.
For businesses, we work with industry partners (retail/CPG) to 1) rapidly digitize large product inventories and 2) organize these inventories across every granular need and preference that matters to a modern consumer — from every allergen and intolerance to the long tail of diets (like Paleo, Gluten-Free, Keto, etc.), conditions, certifications, nutrition preferences and much more.
Current retail partners include Whole Foods, Kroger, and more. Learn more about Pinto and the technologies we power: http://business.pinto.co

1 in 4 Americans have a treatable mental health condition, but the majority of them don't get help because of access and affordability issues (80% of therapists don’t directly accept insurance).

We're addressing this access problem by building a marketplace that deals with the messiness of insurance behind the scenes, so patients can get affordable in-person therapy covered by insurance.

To support our mission, we've raised from VCs (backers of Linkedin, Facebook, Slack, Zocdoc, Oscar) and the nation's most innovative marketplace and healthcare tech founders (One Medical, Seamless Grubhub, Flatiron Health, Clover Health).

We're growing rapidly--we’re already the biggest therapy group in NYC, and in this role you’ll help build products to support orders of magnitude growth in the coming months and years.

Mental Health affects people of all backgrounds, and people of all backgrounds are very strongly encouraged to apply.

You Have: *
You’ve architected and coded back-end services (bonus points if in Python); you’ve shipped code within MVC framework, i.e. Flask (which we use) or Django.

Work with our Head of Engineering to build and lead an engineering team as it grows from one to four within the next nine months.
Work alongside the cofounders to help set the development roadmap and bring to market novel technology solutions to America’s mental health epidemic.
Grow and learn by doing. You’ll contribute to any part of the business that interests you. Interested in product management? Great -- work with us to conduct user research and build out our roadmap. Want to learn about user acquisition? Awesome -- help implement our SEO strategy.
Change the trajectory of a startup striving to redefine access to mental health in America.
Compensation*
Competitive salary, very competitive equity, and robust benefits.
As a mental health health company, we value mental health! While we work hard for our mission, we don’t valorize working hard just for the sake of it. If you need an afternoon off or a WFH day, we support you and won’t question your conviction in our mission.
What matters to you? As a founding team member, you’ll contribute to our culture, values, and decisions like what additional benefits should we offer!"
