ABOUT GLEAN (currently in stealth mode)
Glean is injecting intelligence into expense management. Founded by fintech veteran and seasoned CFO Howard Katzenberg, Glean is an AI-powered spend intelligence solution that saves SMBs money by analyzing expense drivers and finding line-item level insights overlooked by most accounts payable solutions, which are focused on speeding up payment cycles rather than optimizing vendor spend.
Over time, our mission is to become the all-in-one spend management solution for SMBs that uses AI to: analyze spend, manage approval and payment workflows, identify anomalous spend & savings opportunities, benchmark spend performance vs. peers, find & negotiate savings with vendors, and forecast future expense trends.
Glean will be every finance team’s best friend!
Join us!
ABOUT THIS ROLE
We are building the next billion-dollar business in enterprise SAAS. We have an amazing founding team, with experts in product, engineering, data science, and machine learning, and we just launched our MVP. We are now searching for a data scientist that will own the core data science work, build NLP applications, and generate insights.
After we ingest PDFs from clients, we perform OCR, extract the text using text classification models, validate the extraction with a human in the loop, and then map all the data into our canonical taxonomy.
Once the data is mapped to our taxonomy, we have a clean digital invoice-based data asset. We generate insights using this data asset, surfacing line-item level insights to our clients via our web app.
Your role will be critical to generating this intelligence for our clients.
Here are some of the major items you will own at Glean:
Data science code to clean and prepare the data extracted from invoices, including handling nulls, addressing exceptions, imputing data (when possible), and enriching data using third-party APIs
Data science code to validate the goodness of extractions performed by the ML models + human in the loop
Collaborate with vendors to perform OCR and text classification
Develop NLP models to map the extracted data to our canonical taxonomy of vendors and line items (e.g., using word embeddings, etc.) at scale
Once the data has been mapped to the canonical taxonomy, perform feature engineering, generate insights, detect anomalies, and surface the intelligence in a digestible format to the end user
You will work closely with the data engineers to productionize the data science and machine learning code that is developed, and you will work closely with the engineering team to make sure the data science and machine learning pipelines are performant in production.
You’ll be accountable for Glean’s:
Data science vision – ownership over and definition of the data science pipeline, working closely with the executive team, and acting as a thought leader across the company
Technical execution – define, articulate, and execute the data science strategy from launch to scale, managing the day-to-day execution, and implementing best practices
Fast prototyping culture – Develop data science and machine learning applications fast, prototyping quickly to solve thorny business problems without getting bogged down in theory (ship early and often)
Getting your hands dirty - we’re a small team and we have a lot of work ahead of us. You should be excited to roll up your sleeves and help the team in any way you can
Build, build, build – jumping in and writing data science code, from architecture to fixing bugs, delivering NLP and insights within the three months of hire. We'll rely on you and your team to handle day-to-day execution including:
Cleaning the extracted data, validating the accuracy of the extraction, and addressing issues as they occur
Shipping NLP applications to perform mapping of extracted data at scale
Developing and deploying models using PyTorch or TensorFlow
Writing code using PySpark
Performing feature engineering on the cleansed and mapped data
Generating insights and narratives
Performing anomaly detection to surface what the client needs to know fast
Wrangling, standardizing, enhancing, implementing, and monitoring data repositories
Creating workflows to ingest, enrich, and make data available across the Glean platform
PERFECT FIT
You’ll be a perfect fit for the Glean Team if…
You want to join an early-stage startup or you are extremely anxious to be challenged at your first startup
You like the tension between craft and shipping. You have strong ability to quickly and effectively evaluate technical tradeoffs and translate them into short/long term business decisions
You’ve built highly scalable data pipelines and have deep expertise in setting technical vision, architecting, building, and maintaining performant systems, from launch to scale
You are passionate about building / leading data science teams and rapidly developing data pipelines at various stages of growth
You pride yourself in communicating complex concepts, including the ability to distill intricate workflows and systems into clear processes and decisions with measurable company-wide impact
You ask “why” a lot and use critical thinking and data to back up your intuitions. You hate when a customer struggles through your product experience
You have managed a budget before and have seen first-hand the challenges in managing vendor spend

Lead Senior Data Science,"New York, NY",The Trade Desk,None,"WHO WE ARE:
The Trade Desk is a global technology company with a mission to create a better Internet for everyone through principled, intelligent advertising. We help the world's biggest brands reach consumers, and our platform funds content providers and publishers who keep the global Internet free and open for everyone.
Handling over 600 billion queries per day (more than 100X the query volume of search globally), our platform operates at unprecedented scale and generates massive amounts of data. We have also built something even stronger and more valuable: an award-winning culture based on trust, empathy, collaboration, and ownership. By working together across typical dividing lines, we are better as a team than any of us could be apart.
Do you have a passion for solving hard problems at scale? Are you eager to join a trust- based, globally-connected team, where your contributions will make a meaningful difference?
Come and see why Fortune Magazine recently named The Trade Desk among the best small to medium-sized workplaces in the US.
WHO WE ARE LOOKING FOR:
You have a sustained track record of making significant, self-directed, and end-to-end contributions to large and impactful machine learning projects. You think beyond just the task at hand to deeply understand the 'why' behind what you are doing.
You are a driver. You will be driving technical projects and providing leadership in a ground-breaking and fast-paced environment. This includes task planning and conducting code reviews, as well as individual code contribution.
You have a strong sense of data intuition. At our scale, many off-the-shelf modeling techniques (open source and enterprise) simply don't work. You are able to work from first principles and intuition to develop solutions and adapt them to a unique environment.
You are a broadly skilled data scientist with experience embedding models into always-on production systems, working across a variety of technologies and data sources.
You have a product-focused mindset. You have the passion and ability to contribute to the process of discovering what will delight our clients and push forward one of the world's largest and most influential industries toward a vision of openness, transparency, and evidence-based decision-making.
You work with confidence and without ego. Our data scientists have deep knowledge and exercise a high degree of leadership in their daily work. You have strongly-held, defensible ideas, and advocate for what you believe is right. You are also adept at identifying and evaluating trade-offs, willing to be proven wrong, and quick to walk through fire to support your fellow teammates.
You value, seek out, and foster diversity. We are a global team from many diverse backgrounds, with different experiences and perspectives. To complement this team, you will welcome ideas that are different from your own and be skilled at finding and building from common ground.
You are a creative thinker, not bound by ""the way things have always been done."" What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don't need data scientists who know all the answers; we need data scientists who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked.
WHAT YOU WILL BE DOING:
Lead Senior Data Scientists serve both as technical individual contributors and people managers. You will be responsible for owning a technical area as well as building and nurturing a team.
Lead Senior Data Scientists are end-to-end owners. You will participate actively in all aspects of designing, researching, building, and delivering data-focused products for our clients.
Our Data Science team is embedded into nearly a dozen individual, mission-focused engineering teams working across a wide spectrum of technological and scientific challenges. You will have the opportunity, depending on your interests and background, to own problems related to natural language processing and machine learning over hundreds of millions of web pages, graph mining and algorithmic optimization on petabytes of data, and causal inference with missing data - to name a few.
Lead Senior Data Scientists contribute to more than our product – they build up our team. Through a combination of mentoring, technical leadership, and direct people-management, they make others better and raise the bar for those around them.
WHAT YOU BRING TO THE TABLE:
You have an abundance of intellectual curiosity and are enthusiastic to learn (and teach) new technologies / techniques.
You are you comfortable working on an agile, distributed team spanning multiple time zones and continents.
You are able to communicate effectively across both technical and non-technical audiences.
You have over 10 years of experience working in a data-driven role, including leading large and impactful technical projects. You may have an advanced degree in a quantitative field, but it's not a requirement. What and how you can contribute is what's most important to us which is why our consideration is not limited by the level of education you have.
You have experience with big data technologies such as Spark or AWS; are able to write efficient SQL; and are proficient in one or more of the following programming languages: R, Python, Java, or Scala. Variety of technical challenge is one of the best things about working at The Trade Desk as a data scientist though which is why we do not expect you to know every technology we use when you start. What we care about is that you can learn quickly and solve complex problems using the best tools for the job.
The Trade Desk does not accept unsolicited resumes from search firm recruiters. Fees will not be paid in the event a candidate submitted by a recruiter without an agreement in place is hired; such resumes will be deemed the sole property of The Trade Desk. The Trade Desk is an equal opportunity employer. All aspects of employment will be based on merit, competence, performance, and business needs. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, marital status, age, national origin, ancestry, physical or mental disability, medical condition, pregnancy, genetic information, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, veteran status, or any other status protected under federal, state, or local law."

You value, seek out, and foster diversity. We are a global team from many diverse backgrounds, with different experiences and perspectives. To complement this team, you will welcome ideas that are different from your own and be skilled at finding and building from common ground.

You are a creative thinker, not bound by ""the way things have always been done."" What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don't need data scientists who know all the answers; we need data scientists who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked.

WHAT YOU WILL BE DOING:
Our Senior Data Scientists are end-to-end owners. You will participate actively in all aspects of designing, researching, building, and delivering data-focused products for our clients.

Our Data Science team is embedded into nearly a dozen individual, mission-focused engineering teams working across a wide spectrum of technological and scientific challenges. You will have the opportunity, depending on your interests and background, to work on problems related to natural language processing and machine learning over hundreds of millions of web pages; graph mining and algorithmic optimization on petabytes of data; differential privacy across billions of user IDs; and causal inference with missing data - to name a few.

Senior Data Scientists contribute to more than our product – they build up our team. Through a combination of mentoring and technical leadership, they make others better and raise the bar for those around them.
WHAT YOU BRING TO THE TABLE:
You have an abundance of intellectual curiosity and are enthusiastic to learn (and teach) new technologies / techniques.
You are you comfortable working on an agile, distributed team spanning multiple time zones and continents.

You are able to communicate effectively across both technical and non-technical audiences.

You have over 10 years of experience working in a data-driven role. Some of those years of experience may have been spent pursuing an advanced degree in a quantitative field, but it's not a requirement. What and how you can contribute is what's most important to us which is why our consideration is not limited by the level of education you have.

You have experience with big data technologies such as Spark or AWS; are able to write efficient SQL; and are proficient in one or more of the following programming languages: R, Python, Java, or Scala. Variety of technical challenge is one of the best things about working at The Trade Desk as a data scientist though which is why we do not expect you to know every technology we use when you start. What we care about is that you can learn quickly and solve complex problems using the best tools for the job.

The Trade Desk does not accept unsolicited resumes from search firm recruiters. Fees will not be paid in the event a candidate submitted by a recruiter without an agreement in place is hired; such resumes will be deemed the sole property of The Trade Desk. The Trade Desk is an equal opportunity employer. All aspects of employment will be based on merit, competence, performance, and business needs. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, marital status, age, national origin, ancestry, physical or mental disability, medical condition, pregnancy, genetic information, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, veteran status, or any other status protected under federal, state, or local law."

Senior Data Scientist,"New York, NY",Pivotal Software,None,"About Us VIDEO
Founded in 2013, Pivotal Software, Inc. combines our leading cloud-native platform, tools, and methodology to empower the world's largest organizations to adapt to change and build great software. Our technology unleashes developer productivity, while fulfilling our mission to transform how the world builds software.
You
As a data scientist on Pivotal's Data Science team, you'll be working on a wide variety of data problems for a diverse range of clients. You will often be asked to learn new technologies and domains on the fly. You should be comfortable working under deadlines and making tough decisions. Consequently, you will frequently have to balance achieving an immediate goal with scalability and productionalizability.
The role offers room for personal and professional growth, and you won't be working in isolation. Data Science at Pivotal is an encouraging and supportive team, where ideas and challenges are addressed collaboratively. We're looking for the kind of person who will try and solve a problem on their own first, but isn't afraid to ask for help or say ""I don't know.""
Us
The Data Science team at Pivotal is primarily a consulting practice; we are tool agnostic, working with our customers to solve real world problems. Our customers, like us, are cross-disciplinary. We service engagements with use cases running from customer churn to optimization to detecting fraud and misconduct. We are not just doers, we are also educators and enablers.
Your Day
While there is no such thing as a ""typical day"", these are activities we frequently find ourselves doing:
Working with clients to uncover and frame new opportunities for data science. Clients often come to us without a clear understanding of what we can do, so this is our chance to open their eyes to new possibilities for their businesses.
Exploring client datasets, looking for actionable insights we can present.
Engineering features, training models, tuning hyperparameters and evaluating the results. We emphasize rigor, because data science done right at this stage leads to models that shine in production.
Taking the models we build into production. This is an exciting stage for anyone who likes collaborating with engineering teams and seeing their model become real when users interact with it.
Helping our clients develop their internal data science practices, from hiring and recruiting to data capturing, so that they can be successful when we hand off the project.
Required Skills / Experiences
Clear and empathetic communicator. You'll be the one sharing your insights with clients and stakeholders at check-ins, documenting your work, and even explaining your model to client data teams as part of a handoff. As such, communication and empathy are essential parts of your toolkit.
Advanced knowledge of statistical modeling and/or machine learning methods. These are the tools we need to go from analysis to prediction.
Strong programming skills. Left to our own devices most of us work in Python, but learning the client's tech stack is an important part of the job.
Strong exploratory data analysis skills. Every engagement starts with an investigation of the data, and thorough EDA saves us a lot of headaches in the long run.
Some travel is expected, depending on location and skillset. We mostly work out of the Pivotal office closest to the client, but sometimes we have to be on site for an extended period of time.
At least a bachelor's degree in an analytical or technical field. This could be applied mathematics, statistics, computer science, operations research, economics, etc. Higher education welcome and encouraged.
This role will support US government clients that require US citizenship. Given this, US citizenship is required for you to apply.
Desired Skills / Experiences
2+ years of work in a data-centric field (data science or data engineering).
Experience with relational databases.
Exposure and experience working in a Linux environment.
You have a specialization in an area like NLP, optimization, or image processing.
Hands-on experience working in a distributed computing environment or proven theoretical understanding of parallelism.
Pivotal is an Equal Employment Opportunity employer that will consider all qualified applicants, regardless of race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, marital status, gender identity or expression, national origin, genetics, age, disability status, protected veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by applicable law."

Haskell Developer,"New York, NY",Co–Star,None,"Just two years in, 10% of young people in the US (18-25) have tried Co–Star. That growth has been entirely through word of mouth – we have never spent on ads. We have millions of active users, have raised $6m, and just launched our second paid feature.

For thousands of years, astrology has functioned as social glue, giving people the tools to reflect and connect in real, meaningful ways. Co–Star is bringing astrology into the 21st century with an app people call their “best friend,’ compare to ""a board meeting with your best friend, your boss, your mother, and the universe,"" and that therapists recommend to their clients.

Astrology is a deterministic system based on the time it takes a planet to orbit the sun. It's more like folk developmental psychology than it is like fortune cookies. Using NASA data interpreted by humans, Co–Star delivers personalized readings in real time. Our AI strings human-written snippets together to generate hyper-personalized interpretations of planetary movements for millions of people.

What you’ll do
Architect and build our Haskell backend with well-documented, easily-tested code that can gracefully scale to tens of millions of users.
Build an elegant system that takes the infinite complexity of human language, gives our writers tools for expressive composition, and delivers relevant horoscopes to users using aggregated contextual & historical signals.
Use machines to automate a wide variety of repetitive tasks, including some (not all) writing.
Work extremely closely with a small, cross-functional team to negotiate, build, and ship new features with the best bang for our buck.
You may be a good fit for this role if you have:
Hands-on experience writing in Haskell or other functional programming languages using modern architecture paradigms
Developed, scaled, and maintained complex web apps on cloud infrastructure (especially AWS)
A disciplined approach to development, testing, documentation, and code structure in a team environment

We use Python, Haskell, AWS, BigQuery, Swift, and Kotlin. We’re big into cross-functional collaboration. We ideate collectively, ship qualitatively-validated MVPs, and iterate based on internal & customer feedback. We validate what we think people need with iterative user testing, A/B test everything, and use data to inform our decisions. Weekly, the whole team talks through why tests worked or failed. Monthly, the entire company comes together to think of what we want to build.

BENEFITS
Fully covered $0 deductible healthcare (including vision + dental)
Unlimited vacation
Flexible hours
Competitive cash + equity comp
Unlimited equipment budget

ABOUT CO–STAR

Are you passionate about Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Deep Learning? Are you passionate about helping customers build solutions leveraging the state-of-the-art AI/ML/DL tools on Amazon Web Service (AWS)? Come join us!

At Amazon, we’ve been investing deeply in artificial intelligence for over 20 years, and many of the capabilities customers experience in our products are driven by machine learning. Amazon.com’s recommendations engine is driven by machine learning (ML), as are the paths that optimize robotic picking routes in our fulfillment centers. Our supply chain, forecasting, and capacity planning are also informed by ML algorithms. Alexa is fueled by Natural Language Understanding and Automated Speech Recognition deep learning; as is Prime Air, and the computer vision technology in our new retail experience, Amazon Go. We have thousands of engineers at Amazon committed to machine learning and deep learning, and it’s a big part of our heritage.

Within AWS, we’re focused on bringing that knowledge and capability to customers through three layers of the AI stack: 1) Frameworks and Infrastructure with tools like Apache MxNet and TensorFlow, 2) Machine Learning Platforms such as Amazon SageMaker for data scientists, and, 3) API-driven Services like Amazon Lex, Amazon Polly, Amazon Transcribe, Amazon Comprehend, and Amazon Rekognition to quickly add intelligence to applications with a simple API call.

You will interact with other SAs in the field, providing guidance on their customer engagements, and you will develop white papers, blogs, reference implementations, and presentations to enable customers to fully leverage AI/ML on AWS. Additionally, as the voice of the customer, you will work closely with the service teams, and submit product feature requests to drive the platform forward.

You must have deep technical experience working with technologies related to artificial intelligence, machine learning and/or deep learning. A strong mathematics and statistics background is preferred in addition to experience building complex machine learning models. You will be familiar with the ecosystem of software vendors in the AI/ML space, and will leverage this knowledge to help AWS customers in their selection process.
